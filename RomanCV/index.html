<p>
I am twenty one years old Roman Chapagain from Kageshwori Manohara
08 Kathmandu of Nepal. I reflect a varied personality including ambition
and the qualities of generosity and thoughtfulness. I am a well determined
and vigorous individual, yet pleasantly calm. I encourage fighting for what
you desire and believe in, and doing it though God because nothing great
comes easy with God everything is possible.  </p>

<p>
I am a student who is motivated by my love for learning, researching and
succeeding as I strive to become a good outstanding and successful man in
today’s society. I have completed the +2 level in science, at Trinity
international College and currently studying at NAMI college.
Through my passion for performing, I have embraced a fanatical interest in
pageantry from an infant growing up, and so have participated in three
pageants; where one of being rewarded the best player in football soccer
and other two of them were school essay competition and quiz
competition. </p>

<p>
Apart from the above , I have kept a keen interest in establishing new
project and enjoy reading and creating new things and most importantly
spending time with my loved ones.<br>
