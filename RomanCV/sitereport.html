              <h2>1. Introduction</h2> <!-- inroduction described here. -->
              <p>The process of developing websites and web apps is known as web development. It mostly concerns the website's design and functionality.Web development is the process of creating new web site and web applications. futher more web development deals with the basic concept of creating our own logic to make page look attractive. Basically,it deals with the develpment of page site and function how the page works. There are two different sides of it, they are-end and back-end. 
using HTML,CSS,Java script we can develop a good web page. a task to make a portfolio website was given. As per the instruction and basic commands codes used in HTML and CSS we can develp a good web site or page . the basic requirement were having six pages including Home page, CV, Biography,contact. so to complete this tasks various methods we used. I also took help from my senior , different site ,other similar web sites different reference pages.

                  <h3>2. Module Experience</h3> <!-- Module Experience described here. -->
                  <p>Fresh design concepts were suggested during the session in addition to the websites highlighted. Despite the fact that it was a solo exercise, an informal duo talk was held because having more ideas and viewpoints is typically a better option to do this excercise.UI is the front design of web site . This is what the users will interact to. Web site can be buikt in different ways with HTML tags. but having a good UI is the key to built proper user and a friendly web page and sites. I had never work before on developing a wb site this was my first experience. i have designed my web page for the first time. being able to make and plays with different codes HTML I really felt good.this was the staring of my journey to built this web page.
although i was a individual task ,i took helps from my senior friends and different sites i made this project work sucess. However, to make each our works unique i have used different UI designs.
Referreing to the various sites applying materials designs and responsives,own ideas were created for which wireframes and screen mockup were prepared.

                         <p>I really enjoyed completing my projects which was assigned by my college.This way new things were learned and mistakes were corrected.
This is all thanks to the College and respected related parties.
The task of creating one's own website was exciting. In this way, new things were learned and errors were debugged. This venture proved to be a valuable learning experience.Â </p>
